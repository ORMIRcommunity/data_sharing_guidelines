# Data User Agreement

A Data User Agreement (DUA) does not provide a legal basis to share personal data (the consent does). A DUA allows controlling what happens to the data when it is shared. A DUA can be a legal instrument if the data are shared for further processing with similar purposes as the original research project (it gives a legal basis to the secondary data user).

These guidelines are intended to be distinct from data sharing agreements between two users or institutions. Guidelines for data sharing agreements are also provided here.

## Acknowledgment  

This template is provided Open Brain Consent, you can mention that your ethics followed the OBC recommendations: Open Brain Consent working group (2021). The Open Brain Consent: Informing research participants and obtaining consent to share brain imaging data. Human Brain Mapping, 1-7 <https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.25351.>

This template is based on the [Donder's Institute DUA Version RU-DI-HD-1.0](https://data.donders.ru.nl/doc/dua/RU-DI-HD-1.0.html?2). It applies in case musculoskeletal data should be considered  as 'personal data' under the [GDPR](https://gdpr-info.eu/), even after using a pseudo-anonymization procedure (to be checked).

To allow sharing of such personal data, it is recommended to use a Data User Agreement (DUA) over a license. The term "license" is more general than DUA, but both are "contracts" between a licensor and licensee.

Not all licenses that are commonly used online (like GPL, MIT, CC-BY) are appropriate for data or for databases. A "data use agreement" is a specific form of license (or contract) that is designed for data and can take into account that besides the rights of the licensor (e.g. the researcher or the university) there may also be rights of the participants whose data is included, for example relating to re-identification. You could call an "agreement" or a "contract" between data provider and data downloader a "license", but calling it a "data use agreement" makes it more explicit that it is not about the (re)use of a creative work (like written text or code by an author) but reuse of measured/observed data.\

## **General considerations for a Data User Agreement**

This DUA is meant to be sufficiently restrictive to publicly sharing biomedical data, which under GDPR should be seen as personal data. If a direct collaboration for data sharing is in place we recommend to be less restrictive.

-   If applicable, the agreement must specify how to deal with subject confidentiality issues.

-   Points on secondary and derived data redistribution is contentious - and careful consideration should be taken to include this or not (Refer to Point 4 in General Data user agreement for accessing identifiable human data).

-   Related to the above point, you could specify how credits and acknowledgements are to be handled. For instance, if someone uses a template that was built by a researcher or group of researchers who used your data, do you want to be acknowledged as well.
