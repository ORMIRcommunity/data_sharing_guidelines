# Sample Consent Forms from other Institutions

Here is a compilation of data sharing agreement sections that may be useful depending on your jurisdiction.

## **1. University of Calgary (Conjoint Health Research Ethics Board), Canada- consent form wording**.

*Please note that this is not a “blanket” consent, but part of a study-specific consent form. If the participant agrees to use of the data in future research, a new ethics application would be required that describes the new study, and the source of data. However we are not required to ask each participant to reconsent if they have already agreed via the text below.*

USE OF DATA FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

It is your choice whether or not to let researchers share your data and biospecimens for research in the future. If you say “yes,” you can change your mind later, but your data and biospecimens might still be used if they have already been shared.

My de-identified research data may be kept for use in future research to learn about, prevent or treat other health-related problems.

YES

NO

## 2. Hamilton Health Sciences, Ontario, Canada

*Source: AMBERS Study*

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Information from this study will be used for research purposes by AMBERS investigators and staff.  We will make every effort to minimize the possibility that any data obtained during this study can be traced back to you directly. Your identifiable information will not be shared with anyone except with your consent or as required by law. The data (the non-identifiable information collected for the study, including test and scan results and responses to the questionnaires) will be linked to the information that you previously provided during your participation in the XXXX studies.  The data will also be analyzed together with the data from several other bone health studies that have been conducted by Dr. XXXX and Dr. XXXX.  The de-identified data from the study may be used to help create a database of bone and muscle health that would be accessed by many different researchers internationally.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I authorize that my encrypted data from this research project may be used for medical research. 

I understand that the data is encrypted and that the key will be stored securely. The data can be sent to other databases in Switzerland and abroad for analysis if they adhere to the same standards as in Switzerland. All legal data protection requirements are complied with.

I make my decision voluntarily and can withdraw this decision at any time. If I withdraw, my data will be anonymized. I only inform the project management and do not have to justify this decision.

Normally, all data is evaluated as a whole and the results are published in summary form. If there is an important result for my health, it is possible that I will be contacted. If I do not wish to be contacted, I will inform the project management.

If results from the data are commercialized, I am not entitled to a share of the commercial use.

We have adapted this language for MSK imaging applications, excluded language around biospecimens. If you plan to collect biospecimens as part of your study and need to include consent language to share access to biospecimens, then please refer to the original language linked in the above document.

#### Description

*This study is collecting data from you. We would like to make your data available for other research studies that may be done in the future. The research may be about similar diseases or conditions to this study. However, research could also be about unrelated diseases, conditions, or other types of research. These studies may be done by researchers at this institution or other institutions, including commercial entities. Our goal is to make more research possible. We plan to keep your data for* **[Insert time frame as indicated in the study protocol].**

*Your data may be shared with researchers around the world. However, the decision to share your data is controlled by* **[indicate which entity has control]**. *To get your data, future researchers must seek approval from* **[indicate which entity has control]***. The researchers must agree not* *to try to identify you.*

**Option #1: If the data are coded and can be linked back to the identity of the participant:**

*We will protect the confidentiality of your information to the extent possible. Your data will be coded to protect your identity before they are shared with other researchers.* **[indicate which entity has the code key]** *will have a code key that can be used to link to your identifying information. The code key will be securely stored.*

**Option #2: If the data cannot be easily linked back to the identity of the participant:**

*Your name and identifying information will be removed from any data you provide before they are shared with other researchers. Researchers cannot easily link your identifying information to the data.*

#### Consent/Withdrawal

**Option 1: When sharing of data will be optional (e.g., for studies** **that have potential benefit):**

*It is your choice whether or not to let researchers share your data for research in the future. If you say “yes,” you can change your mind later. If you say “no,” you can still fully participate in this study.*

*If you change your mind and no longer wish to have us store or share your data, you should contact **[insert contact info]*****.** *We will do our best to honor your request and to retrieve any data that have been shared with other researchers. However,* *there may be times we cannot. For example, if we do not have a way to identify your data we will not be able to retrieve them.* *In addition, if the data have already been used for new research, the information from that research may still be used.*

*Please initial **[or sign depending on institutional practice]** next to your choice:*

\_\_\_\_\_\_**YES,** use my data in other research studies

\_\_\_\_\_\_**NO, do NOT use** my data in other research studies

**Option 2: When sharing of data will not be optional (e.g., where sharing is integral to the purpose of the study):**

*Participating in this study means you agree to share your data. You can change your mind later, but researchers might still use your data if they have already been shared. If you do not want your data used for other projects, you should not participate in this study.*

#### 
Risks/Benefits

**[Risks]** *We will do our best to protect your data during storage and when they are shared. However, there remains a possibility that someone could identify you. There is also the possibility that unauthorized people might access your data. In either case, we cannot reduce the risk to zero.*

**[Benefits]** *You will not receive any direct benefit from sharing your data. However,* s*haring your data may contribute to research that could help others in the future.*
