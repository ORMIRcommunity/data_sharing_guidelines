# Data anonymization

Data anonymization is important because it **protects the privacy and confidentiality** of individuals whose data is being used.

## Data de-identification vs. anonymization
The degree of data anonymization is important because it determines the sharing regulations. 
There are at least two levels of data anonymization {cite:p}`White2022`: 

- **Fully anonymized data**: All personal identifiers are removed, and a separate identification code is assigned. The link between the anonymized dataset and any trace back to the original data is permanently deleted

- **De-identified data**: Personal information is removed from the dataset, and individuals are assigned a unique identification number. However, a key is retained that allows the de-identified data to be linked back to the original personal data if needed
