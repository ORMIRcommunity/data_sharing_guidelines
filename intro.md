This is a small book generated during the 2nd Open and Reproducible Musculoskeletal Imaging Research Workshop held January 2024.

The ORMIR Image Data Index

The *Open and Reproducible Musculoskeletal Imaging Research* (ORMIR) community is an international cooperative of musculoskeletal imaging research scientists who aim to promote a culture of openness and reproducibility in MSK imaging research through development of open and reproducible software, development of standardized acquisition and analysis workflows, and promotion of open data sharing practices.

The ORMIR Image Data Index is a member-curated repository of metadata from musculoskeletal imaging research studies currently under development. Central to the development of this resource are core guidelines essential to responsible data sharing, including:

1.  Resources and examples of informed consent language used to prospectively acquire consent for data sharing

2.  Resources and examples of data use agreements for sharing of research data between institutions

3.  A list of recommended image data repositories

4.  Resources and guidelines for data de-identification

5.  Description of meta-data that can be submitted to the planned ORMIR Image Data Index

These core elements will be included in this book, as they become available.
